= Purpose
To explore interop between python and Rust.

= Why?
- Rust code runs much faster and uses less resources.
- But Rust is harder to develop. Iteration on a Rust project is commonly slower than in python.
- Ideal project development may be to write the body in python but to optimize parts in Rust.
